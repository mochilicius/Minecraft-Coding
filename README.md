Welcome! This repository serves as a portfolio and a collaborative space for our team to showcase their coding projects.

## Why post these?

The projects here demonstrate practical applications of programming concepts—such as logic, automation, and design—that align with our coursework and college requirements. 
By contributing to and collaborating on these Minecraft coding projects, we can count our work towards our required study hours and gain hands-on experience that supports our academic growth.

## SK Unity & Mythic Mobs

Our projects often use [SK Unity](https://github.com/SkUnity/skUnity-Docs) and [Mythic Mobs](https://mythicmobs.net/).

**SK Unity** is a powerful scripting tool for Minecraft, and its syntax is somewhat similar to Java. 
This makes it easier for those familiar with programming logic to create custom mechanics, automate tasks, and bring creative ideas to life in Minecraft. However, SK Unity doesn’t have many built-in tools for working directly with other plugins, so we often have to figure out clever workarounds and solutions to make everything connect smoothly.

**Mythic Mobs** lets us create custom mobs and bosses with unique abilities, behaviors, and appearances. 
It’s essential for the creation of custom mini-games, custom items, armor, etc.

By combining SK Unity and Mythic Mobs, we can build advanced features and custom content that wouldn’t be possible otherwise!
